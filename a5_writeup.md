# Assignment 5 Write up

Assignment 5 can be broken up into the following parts:
1. Import the Necessary Modules:
- `copy`: For creating deep copies of objects
- `Stack` and `Queue`: Custom implementations for DFS and BFS operations
2. Utility Functions: 
- `remove_if_exists`: Removes a specified element from a list if it exists, which is used to remove the possibilites from a cell
3. Board Class:
- Represents the Sudoku board
- Consists of functions that will find the most constrained cell, and update the board, which eliminates possible solutions
4. DFS & BFS Functions:
- `DFS`: Uses depth-first search to solve the Sudoku puzzle. It works by trying to fill the most constrained cell with potential values until a solution is found or backtracks if a mistake is made
- `BFS`: Uses breadth-first search to solve the Sudoku puzzle in a similar fashion to DFS but explores nodes level by level
5. Main Execution:
- Defines two different sets of initial moves for Sudoku puzzles
- Uses both DFS and BFS to solve each puzzle and prints the results


After completing the assignment, answer the following reflection questions:

## Reflection Questions

1. How do the performance and efficiency of the Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms compare when solving Sudoku puzzles? In what scenarios might one approach be preferable over the other?

I think DFS was faster for sudoku because it iterated through the puzzle one by one instead of searching the breadth of puzzle, which would take a lot longer. I'd say BFS would work better for smaller puzzles.


2. How did the choice of data structures (like the Stack for DFS and Queue for BFS) impact the implementation and functionality of the algorithms? Are there alternative data structures or design patterns that could have been used to achieve the same objectives?

Since stack goes LIFO, the solutions were found more easily and more straightforward. Since quene goes FIFO, the solutions were found level by level and took a little bit longer.

3. Considering the current implementation, how might the Sudoku solver be adapted or extended for larger puzzles or different types of grid-based logic games? How can the lessons learned from this assignment be applied to real-world problem-solving or optimization challenges?

I think a solver problem like this could be made more complex to complete more advanced games like checkers, chess, monopoly (potentially), etc. I think applying concepts like BFS and DFS would make other programs similar to the sudoku solver easier to complete.
